# Note Taker

## Description
This project is refractored from a starter code designed as a personal note taker to track personal tasks by adding and saving notes. Users can help manage their day-to-day needs by adding notes. These are the highlighted proficicncies throughout the development process:
* fs
* routing
* Express.js
* GET/POST/DELETE requests
* Heroku deployment for live website


# Installations & Usage
Users will need to install npm libaries by running: 
> npm i <br>

Then, initialize the server script through the CLI by running:
> node server.js
> Open <http://localhost:3001> on a web broswer <br>

To add a new note, click the plus sign on the top right-hand corner or to save a current note, click the save icon next to the plus sign. To delete a note, click the red trashcan next to your title note.
